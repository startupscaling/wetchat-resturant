# NLP Module Project

This project was carried out to solve three specific tasks related to NLP.

## Description

The project has three classes that are used throughout the program, each of them has the purpose of solving the following tasks:
* <b>Sentiment Analysis for movie reviews</b>:
    For this task I selected the "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english" for running a sentiment analysis on a movie reviews dataset, then the output printed     to the terminal.
* <b>Training a NER Model for a medical purpose</b>:
    For this task a model from scratch using Spacy and the Medical NER dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/finalepoch/medical-ner), the training loss graph can be     viewed when running the program, also some metrics are used to evaluate the model.

* <b>Obtaining the Bleu Score of translations (english to spanish) made by AWS and GCP Translation APIs</b>:
    For this task we will use the AWS and GCP Translation APIs, to set up the env file which contains the AWS API keys you will have to create a new "secrets.env" and     write the following variables: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SESSION_TOKEN, REGION_NAME.
    To make this process much easier there is a function on the Translate class which takes like paramas the secrets.env and the json file from GCP.
    
### Installing
Installation of the project can be done by following these steps:
* Make a new virtual environment using Anaconda or venv.
* Activate your virtual environment.
* Execute the following command in the terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt (you can use the requirments.txt file from this repository).


### Executing program

* Activate a virtual environment or create a new one.
* Move to the directory where you cloned this repo.
* Execute the following command in the terminal: py run.py
